# Hot Macro Trader
A spiffy (open) trade execution engine for people who like hotkeys and macros.

## Purpose
Why does every pro level tool for the financial market have to be any or all of the following:
- Look like its for the 90s
- Windows only
- Cryptic
- Web only
- Do everything poorly and nothing with excellence? 
- Terribly unfocused 

And yet somehow independent people who use financial market have to depend on these tools, and often pay extra for them. *cough* DAS.

It's 2024, so let's build something better, for free, that focuses on just one thing. Getting trade execution right.

## Focused Trade Execution
This application has only one purpose. To empower you to make trade executions how you want to. Want to buy 1000 shares on the bid with a single button? Cool. Want to buy 1000 shares ONLY if the price has increased beyond a certain number? (A reverse limit?) no problem.

## What the application is good for
- Day trading
- Scalping

## What this application does not do.
- Charting

## What the application might do in the future.
- Provide realtime level 2 data
- Provide realtime time and sales
